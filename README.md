# Terraform Cloud Infrastructure Project

This repository contains the Terraform configurations for a scalable and modular cloud infrastructure on AWS. It's designed to demonstrate how to use Terraform to provision a VPC, subnets, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), and EC2 instances in a structured and reusable manner.

## Features

- **VPC Configuration:** Set up a Virtual Private Cloud to securely host your resources.
- **Subnet Creation:** Provision public and private subnets to organize resources based on exposure to the public internet.
- **ALB Setup:** Deploy an Application Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic among EC2 instances.
- **EC2 Instances:** Launch EC2 instances within your VPC subnets to host your applications.

## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed on your machine.
- An AWS account and AWS CLI configured with access credentials.

## Usage

1. **Initialize Terraform:** Navigate to the environment directory you wish to deploy (`environments/dev` or `environments/prod`), and run:

```bash
terraform init
```

2. **Review the Plan:** Generate an execution plan to see the changes Terraform will perform:

```bash
terraform plan
```

3. **Apply Configuration:** Apply the Terraform configuration to provision the resources:

```bash
terraform apply
```
